\section*{\textbf{Problem Statement:}}
The idea is to develop a software for an \textbf{online hotel room reservation system}. The system is built to handle multiple types of clients like tourists and members, and perform actions like \textbf{reserve, check-in to and check-out from rooms}. The program also \textbf{suggests travel packages/offers based on locations, season, pricing etc.} This application acts as a one-stop solution for both management and tourists alike, to ensure a smooth experience for everyone within the walls of the hotels.
